            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              An ovum donor or simply an egg donor, is a young lady age 21-30 years who voluntarily agrees to donate her eggs to another couple with the purpose of helping them achieve pregnancy. Because egg donors are usually younger than the intending mother, chances of conception are higher and achieving a pregnancy is higher.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Despite the fact that the baby from this program would not be genetically linked to you, you would have the joy of experiencing a pregnancy, carrying the pregnancy to term, enjoying the beautiful moments and giving birth to your baby.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Other benefits include the ability to deliberately choose your babyâ€™s genetical source to the best of your ability. You have a say in the choice of donor used under the comfort of total and complete anonymity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              You shall be matched with your donor based on your blood group, genotype, physical similarities, social, educational, family and vocational backgrounds as well as review their fertility and previous donation records where they are repeat donors with our organization.
