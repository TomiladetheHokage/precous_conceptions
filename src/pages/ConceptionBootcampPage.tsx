              Hello my name is Toyin Lolu-Ogunmade, an infertility survivor, a proud mom to a set of twins through gestational surrogacy and the author of the best selling book, MOM At Last, my 13 year journey.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              I am the Founder& CEO, Precious Conceptions, Nigeria’s foremost Holistic Family Building Consultancy, which helps intending parents identify, improve and maximize their conception chances.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              My journey to motherhood took 13 years. I realized, during my infertility struggle, that if I had known what I know now, and had the sort of help available now, I probably wouldn’t have ended up going through IVF Surrogacy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              That’s why I am here… talking with you today.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Do you know that infertility is an illness, and if caught early, can be reversed, controlled, managed and overcome?
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Do you realize that with the right help and a bit more push in terms of Holistic approach (wellness, nutrition, exercise, and ovulation monitoring, faith factor) most people can conceive spontaneously especially if they get help early?
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              That is why Precious Conceptions is Partnering with World Class Natural Conception Specialists to create awareness about this. We want you to get pregnant in your bedroom, if this is your advantage. And we can help you with it!!
